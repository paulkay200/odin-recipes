    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spicy chicken with peanuts, similar to what is served in Chinese restaurants. It is easy to make, and you can be
        as sloppy with the measures as you want. They reduce a to a nice, thick sauce. Substitute cashews for peanuts,
        or bamboo shoots for the water chestnuts. You can't go wrong. Enjoy!
